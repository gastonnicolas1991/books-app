## Tooling

- Storybook
- Prettier
- ESlint
- React.js 
- Styled Components
- Node.js
- Axios
  
## Storybook

Components were built isolated in Storybook. The idea is them to be as dummiest as possible and inject behavior from its context, in the client project.

```bash
cd rick-and-morty/client
npm run storybook

```
We should see it running on: http://localhost:6006/

## Notes 

- Make sure you have Node.js up to version 12 cause previous versions could have issues with some libraries
